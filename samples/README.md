How to run samples:
<pre>
1. Setup "samples" project as maven project. This is a sub project. It has dependency on "oneview-sdk-java-lib" project.
2. Create truststore and keystore. These are currently placed in src/main/resource. But user is free to change the location. Read about creating truststore and keystore [here](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-sdk-java/wiki#steps-to-generate-keystore-and-truststore).
3. Edit SampleRestParam.java file to set appliance IP and credentials.
4. Run any of the sample programs.
